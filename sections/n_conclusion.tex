\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

AuctionWhisk adds a new dimension to Fog Computing and the FaaS paradigm by introducing auctions.
This extension has the potential to increase reliability in unreliable Fog systems. Moreover, it offers clients of such a system more control over cost in relation to performance and gives them flexibility through bidding strategies. 
However, auctions also introduce more complexity into the system and counteract the common FaaS promise of an easily useable platform. 
In addition, by being strictly stateless, auctions do not offer sophisticated function scheduling on a global level which worsen resource utilization and efficiency.
