\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Function-as-a-service (FaaS), often also referred to as serverless computing, is a relatively new paradigm, where code is only run on demand in isolated environments. 
This makes it possible to bill users in a fine-grained manner, depending on metrics like number of executions or execution time. \cite{10.1145/3352460.3358296}

In practice FaaS deployments are often optimized to either run in large datacenters of big public cloud providers \cite{288770}, \cite{9302817} (from here on out also referred to as Cloud) or in designated edge-distributed networks\footnote{For example, Cloudflare's Worker platform is deployed on their globally distributed CDN}. 
However, as researchers and industries attempt to improve performance and reduce latency further, the attention has also shifted towards alternatives. 

One of those potential alternatives is Fog Computing, which we will here define as a fusion of Cloud and Edge Computing where computation resources are deployed on the network paths in between as to split up load over a more diverse infrastructure. 
That is, each layer between the Cloud and the Edge offers a unique trade-off between resource availability and latency. \cite{9326369}

Efficiently leveraging the distributed and heterogeneous resources of the aforementioned infrastructure, creates a new set of issues in addition to the preexisting challenges in distributed systems: 
For instance, determining appropriate scheduling algorithms or optimal allocation of available resources. 
AuctionWhisk proposed a new way of solving those issues by using an auction inspired approach. 
Auctions allow for stateless function scheduling without making assumptions on a centralized source of truth by creating a self-contained environment based on developer bids for a function. 
As in a real auction, the platform can determine the functions that should be scheduled -- respective winners of the auction -- based on those bids.


In this essay, we make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using auctions to determine function placement and execution.
    \item We evaluate applications that could potentially benefit or suffer from this approach.
\end{enumerate}
