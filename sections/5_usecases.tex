\section{Use-cases} %TODO
\label{sec:usecases}

The trade-offs AuctionWhisk makes, enable it to work well in some use cases, whilst potentially performing poorly in others. 
The following sections summarize the systems advantages and disadvantages by introducing two examples: On the one hand a scenario AuctionWhisk is optimally suited to handle, and on the other hand a situation that  that does not perform well. To consider only comparable alternatives and draw a relevant conclusion, we will only consider alternatives that are also based on the FaaS paradigm.

\subsection{A}

In the first instance, we will observe an environment where latency is paramount and other aspects, such as cost

\subsection{}

stable latency / performance
