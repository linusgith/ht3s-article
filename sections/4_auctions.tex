% Rephrase this better -> maybe this also belongs in my own part?
% For the aforementioned established deployments this means, that assumptions on resources can be made and one of two cases is expected: 
% Either enough resources are available for a request to be executed instantly or requests are queued. From an architecture perspective this is reasonable since there is only one system layer capable of request execution, and we expect it to provide sufficient resources to handle the load.
% Contrarily, for FaaS in a fog environment, a request is forwarded instead of queued, since there are multiple serving layers, and it can not be assumed that a particular one is able to handle all load.
