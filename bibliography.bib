  abstract = {Serverless computing is a rapidly growing cloud application model, popularized by Amazon's Lambda platform. Serverless cloud services provide fine-grained provisioning of resources, which scale automatically with user demand. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) applications follow this serverless model, with the developer providing their application as a set of functions which are executed in response to a user- or system-generated event. Functions are designed to be short-lived and execute inside containers or virtual machines, introducing a range of system-level overheads. This paper studies the architectural implications of this emerging paradigm. Using the commercial-grade Apache OpenWhisk FaaS platform on real servers, this work investigates and identifies the architectural implications of FaaS serverless computing. The workloads, along with the way that FaaS inherently interleaves short functions from many tenants frustrates many of the locality-preserving architectural structures common in modern processors. In particular, we find that: FaaS containerization brings up to 20x slowdown compared to native execution, cold-start can be over 10x a short function's execution time, branch mispredictions per kilo-instruction are 20x higher for short functions, memory bandwidth increases by 6x due to the invocation pattern, and IPC decreases by as much as 35\% due to inter-function interference. We open-source FaaSProfiler, the FaaS testing and profiling platform that we developed for this work.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm has a lot of potential as a computing model for fog environments comprising both cloud and edge nodes, as compute requests can be scheduled across the entire fog continuum in a fine-grained manner. When the request rate exceeds capacity limits at the resource-constrained edge, some functions need to be offloaded toward the cloud. In this article, we present an auction-inspired approach in which application developers bid on resources while fog nodes decide locally which functions to execute and which to offload in order to maximize revenue. Unlike many current approaches to function placement in the fog, our approach can work in an online and decentralized manner. We also present our proof-of-concept prototype AuctionWhisk that illustrates how such an approach can be implemented in a real FaaS platform. Through a number of simulation runs and system experiments, we show that revenue for overloaded nodes can be maximized without dropping function requests.},

  abstract = {The cloud is migrating to the edge of the network, where routers themselves may become the virtualisation infrastructure, in an evolution labelled as "the fog". However, many other complementary technologies are reaching a high level of maturity. Their interplay may dramatically shift the information and communication technology landscape in the following years, bringing separate technologies into a common ground. This paper offers a comprehensive definition of the fog, comprehending technologies as diverse as cloud, sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, network virtualisation functions or configuration management techniques. We highlight the main challenges faced by this potentially breakthrough technology amalgamation.},
